## About
This project is my take at a game called _**Coin Apocalypse**_[^1] by small independent dev Drakensang. Unfortunately, the original of this game doesn't work at this time because it was developed with Adobe Flash platform - which isn't supported nowadays. 

_**CoinApocalypse-Redux**_ is as a Semestral project created by me for a class called "Programming in Java I". Students should learn the basics of Java (OOP, Collections, Libraries, Databases and basics of networking) and therefore our goal was to make a simple "8-Bit-like" game, that would focus on those aspects. Hence this is my firt Java project (my background is in C++), this might not be perfect, but it is working.

I'm going to work on this project throughout my career as I am certain that in the future I will be more and more embarrased by the codebase I've just released - and that's someting, no programmer wishes to have. Bad - but working - codebase that is public. :)  

Feel free to inspire yourself and if need be, comment and objectively critize.
